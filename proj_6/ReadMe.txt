To run:

Simply click on index.html

The page may appear frozen, but this is because it is running our first algorithm and reading in the data still.

To run the simulation again, or after changing the settings, click "Run Simulation".

Other Notes:

The drop down for the algorithms only has algorithms for "one" and "two" for Project6b. The others are placeholders.

For "Stock Data For" this will update 2 of the graphs with the data for said stock selected. 

These graphs are for the closed values of the stocks, as well as the amount of the stock we owned for the selected algorithm.
